This project has been developed upon request of a client willing to open a cat shop. 

The project had to contain the basics required for the beginning of a business: 
adding new products, updating stock, recording sales and customers, processing changes in the inventory...

This is a first unfinished version for the basic functioning of this new business.
In future releases we hope to achieve new functionalities that will automatise the daily processes of the project.
